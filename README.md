# Car Parking Project

## Overview

The Car Parking Project is a real-time computer vision application that detects cars in parking spaces and monitors parking lot occupancy. It combines Haar Cascade Classifier with TensorFlow Lite for object detection to provide a comprehensive parking management solution.

### Features

- **Car Detection**: Uses Haar Cascade Classifier to identify cars in predefined regions.
- **Object Detection**: Employs TensorFlow Lite for advanced object detection and tracking.
- **Parking Space Monitoring**: Displays live updates on parking lot occupancy.
- **Pathway Status**: Indicates if the pathway is free or occupied.
